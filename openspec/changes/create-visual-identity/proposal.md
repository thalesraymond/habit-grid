# Visual Identity & Habit Grid

## Goal
Establish the visual identity of the Habit Grid application, defaulting to a dark mode aesthetic, and implement the core "Habit Grid" component. This component will serve as the "main star" of the application, visualizing habit progress in a GitHub-contribution-style grid.

## Context
The app currently lacks a distinct visual identity and its core feature, the habit grid. This proposal aims to define the look and feel (dark mode) and implement the primary visualization component using mock data to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Technical
- **Theme**: Dark mode by default.
- **Component**: `HabitGrid` - a 7-row (days) x N-column (weeks) grid.
- **Data**: Mock data generator to simulate "fullness" levels (empty, low, medium, high).
- **Styling**: NativeWind/Tailwind CSS.

## Values
- **Aesthetics**: Premium, developer-centric (GitHub vibes).
- **Clarity**: distinct visual hierarchy for different completion levels.

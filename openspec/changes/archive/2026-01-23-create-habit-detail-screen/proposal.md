# Proposal: Create Habit Detail Screen

## Summary
Introduce a dedicated "Habit Detail" screen that provides users with a comprehensive view of a specific habit's history and statistics. This screen will serve as the deep-dive view, accessible from the home screen.

## Motivation
Currently, users can only see a brief history (last ~5 days) of their habits on the home screen. To effectively track progress and stay motivated, users need:
1.  **Immediate Action**: A focused place to mark habits as complete.
2.  **Long-term Context**: A heatmap showing consistency over months.
3.  **Detailed History**: A calendar view to pinpoint specific missed days.
4.  **Motivation**: Statistics like streaks and completion rates.

## Details
The new screen will include:
1.  **Hero Section**: Habit title, current streak, and a "Mark Complete" button.
2.  **Heatmap**: A GitHub-style contribution graph specific to the habit (last 6 months+).
3.  **Stats**: Cards for Current Streak, Best Streak, and Monthly Completion.
4.  **History**: A generic monthly calendar view.

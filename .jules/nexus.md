## 2024-05-22 - [Mock Data Trap] Insight: [The "Aha!" Moment]
Insight: The application was built as a "Potemkin Village" - beautiful UI but completely hollow data shell. Users can't "try" a habit tracker that doesn't track.
Action: In future specs, always couple the "Hero Component" (like the Grid) with at least local state persistence immediately. UI without State is just a drawing.

**Insight**: The application currently relies entirely on mock data (`utils/mockData.ts`) and hardcoded lists in `HomeScreen`. The "Add Habit" button exists but has no functionality.
**Action**: The immediate priority is to bridge the gap between the visual shell and a functional app by implementing the "Create Habit" flow with local persistence. This transforms the app from a demo to a usable utility.
